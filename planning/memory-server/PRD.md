# Memory Server - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Memory Server is a developer-focused memory storage system designed to provide long-term persistence of development notes, useful information, and resources. Built on Cloudflare's edge infrastructure and exposed as an HTTP Streamable MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server, it enables LLM agents to seamlessly store, retrieve, and manage developer knowledge.

**Key Value Propositions:**
- Persistent storage for development knowledge accessible by AI agents
- Edge-deployed for global low-latency access
- Rich content management with URL fetching and caching
- Full-text search capabilities across stored memories
- Developer-friendly web interface for memory management

## Problem Statement

**Problem:** Developers working with LLM agents lack a persistent, structured way to store and retrieve long-term development knowledge, code snippets, useful resources, and project insights that can be seamlessly accessed across different AI interactions and development sessions.

**Current Pain Points:**
- Information stored in chat sessions is lost when conversations end
- No centralized, AI-accessible knowledge base for development resources
- Manual copy-pasting of URLs and content between sessions
- Lack of searchable, tagged storage for development notes
- No persistence layer for AI agent interactions

**Solution:** A cloud-hosted memory system that provides persistent storage with intelligent content fetching, full-text search, and MCP integration for seamless AI agent access.

## Goals & Success Metrics

2. **AI Agent Integration**: Seamless MCP integration for LLM agent access
3. **Intelligent Content Management**: Automatic URL content fetching and caching
4. **Efficient Search & Retrieval**: Fast full-text search across all stored memories

### Success Metrics
- **Performance**: API response times < 200ms (95th percentile)
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime through Cloudflare edge deployment
- **Storage Efficiency**: URL content cached for 5 days with <1% cache miss rate
- **Search Quality**: Full-text search returns relevant results in <100ms
- **Usage**: Support for 10,000+ memories with pagination and efficient queries
