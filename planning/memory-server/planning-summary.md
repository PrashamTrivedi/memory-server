# Memory Server - Planning Summary

## Executive Summary

The Memory Server is a developer-focused memory storage system designed to provide persistent knowledge management for AI agents through MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. Built on Cloudflare's serverless infrastructure, it delivers global edge performance with comprehensive search capabilities and a React-based management interface.

### Core Value Propositions
- **AI-Native Integration**: First-class MCP support with 7 specialized tools for LLM agents
- **Global Performance**: Sub-200ms response times through Cloudflare edge deployment
- **Intelligent Caching**: 15-day URL content caching with Browser Rendering API integration
- **Developer-Friendly**: No authentication required, designed for personal development workflows
- **Full-Text Search**: FTS5-powered search with sub-100ms query performance

## Key Architectural Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Serverless-First Architecture
**Decision**: Cloudflare Workers + D1 + KV
**Rationale**: 
- Global edge deployment for sub-200ms latency
- Auto-scaling with pay-per-use model
- Integrated caching and database services
- Simplified deployment and maintenance

### 2. Extended Caching Strategy
**Decision**: 15-day TTL for URL content caching
**Rationale**: 
- Cost optimization for Browser Rendering API usage
- Reduced latency for frequently accessed content
- Configurable extension to manage operational costs

### 3. Domain-Driven Design
**Decision**: Memory, URL Content, and Search service boundaries
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved testability and maintainability
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements

### 4. MCP HTTP Streamable Server
**Decision**: TypeScript SDK with HTTP transport
**Rationale**:
- Broad compatibility with MCP clients
- Better debugging and monitoring capabilities
- Simplified testing and integration

## Implementation Timeline & Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation Layer (Weeks 1-2)
- **Milestone**: Core data model and database schema
- **Deliverables**: D1 database setup, Memory CRUD operations, UUID generation
- **Success Criteria**: All database tests passing, migration system working

### Phase 2: Content Management & Search (Weeks 3-4)
- **Milestone**: URL processing and search capabilities
- **Deliverables**: Browser Rendering integration, FTS5 search, KV caching
- **Success Criteria**: <100ms search performance, 15-day caching working

### Phase 3: MCP Server Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- **Milestone**: Complete MCP tool implementation
- **Deliverables**: All 7 MCP tools, HTTP Streamable server, resource registration
- **Success Criteria**: MCP Inspector validation, <200ms tool response times

### Phase 4: Web User Interface (Weeks 7-8)
- **Milestone**: React management interface
- **Deliverables**: Memory CRUD UI, search interface, tag management
- **Success Criteria**: Responsive design, accessibility compliance, user testing

### Phase 5: Production Deployment (Week 9)
- **Milestone**: Production-ready deployment
- **Deliverables**: Cloudflare configuration, monitoring, optimization
- **Success Criteria**: Health checks passing, performance benchmarks met

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies

### High-Priority Risks
1. **Browser Rendering API Costs**
   - **Mitigation**: Extended 15-day caching, usage monitoring, rate limiting
   - **Fallback**: Manual URL content entry option

2. **D1 FTS5 Performance Limitations**
   - **Mitigation**: Query optimization, proper indexing, performance testing
   - **Fallback**: External search service integration (Algolia)

3. **MCP Client Compatibility**
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing with MCP Inspector
   - **Fallback**: Direct HTTP API access

### Medium-Priority Risks
1. **Development Bottlenecks**: Parallel development with mocked interfaces
2. **Cloudflare Service Limits**: Resource monitoring and alerting
3. **Performance Degradation**: Continuous performance testing

## Success Criteria & Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Criteria
- **API Response Time**: <200ms (95th percentile)
- **Search Performance**: <100ms for full-text queries
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >80% for URL content
- **Uptime**: >99.9% availability

### Quality Criteria
- **Test Coverage**: >90% backend, >85% frontend
- **Security**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Lighthouse scores >90

### Business Criteria
- **MCP Integration**: All 7 tools functioning correctly
- **Search Functionality**: Tag-based and content-based search working
- **User Experience**: Intuitive memory management interface
- **Cost Management**: Browser Rendering costs within budget

## Next Steps for Development Teams

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Database Team**: Implement D1 schema and migration system
2. **Backend Team**: Setup domain services and repository patterns  
3. **Frontend Team**: Initialize React project with component structure
4. **DevOps Team**: Configure Cloudflare Workers environment

### Development Workflow
1. **Local Development**: Use wrangler dev with D1 local emulation
2. **Testing Strategy**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
3. **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier
4. **Deployment**: Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Quality Assurance
1. **Unit Testing**: 425 test cases across backend and frontend
2. **Integration Testing**: MCP tool validation with Inspector
3. **Performance Testing**: Load testing with simulated workloads
4. **Security Testing**: OWASP validation and dependency scanning
