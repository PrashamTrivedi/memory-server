# Triage Report: `add_memory` Tool Failure

## 1. Summary

The `add_memory` MCP tool was failing with a cryptic error message. The investigation revealed that the tool was being called without the required parameters. The resolution is to call the tool with the correct arguments as defined in its schema.

## 2. Problem

When attempting to add a memory to the `memoryServer` using the `add_memory` tool, the tool call failed with the following error:

```
MCP error -32603: keyValidator._parse is not a function
```

This error message was not informative enough to directly identify the root cause.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the issue was an incorrect invocation of the `add_memory` tool. The tool was called without any arguments, while its definition in `/root/Code/memory-server/src/mcp/tools/memory.ts` clearly specifies that it requires `name` and `content` parameters.

The `inputSchema` for the `addMemoryTool` is as follows:

```typescript
inputSchema: {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    name: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Name or title of the memory',
    },
    content: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Content of the memory',
    },
    url: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Optional URL to fetch content from',
      format: 'uri',
    },
    tags: {
      type: 'array',
      items: { type: 'string' },
      description: 'Optional tags to associate with the memory',
    },
  },
  required: ['name', 'content'],
},
```

The server-side validation of the tool's input parameters failed in a way that produced the unhelpful "keyValidator._parse is not a function" error instead of a clear message about missing parameters.

## 4. Resolution

The resolution is to call the `add_memory` tool with the required `name` and `content` arguments, and optionally with `url` and `tags`.

## 5. Action Plan

My plan to add the remaining memories to the `memoryServer` is as follows:

1.  Parse the output of the `pocket_list` command to extract the ID, text, and tags for each memory.
2.  Iterate through each memory.
3.  For each memory, call the `add_memory` tool with the following parameters:
    *   `name`: The ID of the memory from pocket pick.
    *   `content`: The text of the memory from pocket pick.
    *   `tags`: The tags associated with the memory from pocket pick.
